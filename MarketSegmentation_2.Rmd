# The Process

The "high level" process template is split in 3 parts, corresponding to the course sessions 3-4, 5-6, and an optional last part: 

1. *Part 1*: We use some of the survey questions (e.g.in this case 10 factors) to find **key customer descriptors** ("factors") using *dimensionality reduction* techniques described in the [Dimensionality Reduction](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions23/FactorAnalysisReading.html) reading of Sessions 3-4.

2. *Part 2*: We use the selected employee responses to **segment the responses** using *cluster analysis* techniques described in the [Cluster Analysis ](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions45/ClusterAnalysisReading.html) reading of Sessions 5-6.

3. *Part 3*: For the segments we create, we will use *classification analysis* to classify people based on whether or not they have purchased a product and find what are the **key purchase drivers per segment**. For this part we will use [classification analysis ](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions67/ClassificationAnalysisReading.html) techniques.

Finally, we will use the results of this analysis to make business decisions e.g. about brand positioning, product development, etc depending on our market segments and key purchase drivers we find at the end of this process.

# The Data

First we load the data to use (see the raw .Rmd file to change the data file as needed):

```{r setupdata1E, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER the name of the file with the data used. The file should be a .csv with one row per observation (e.g. person) and one column per attribute. Do not add .csv at the end, make sure the data are numeric.
datafile_name = "data/HR_comma_sep.csv"

# Please enter the minimum number below which you would like not to print - this makes the readability of the tables easier. Default values are either 10e6 (to print everything) or 0.5. Try both to see the difference.
MIN_VALUE = 0.5

# Please enter the maximum number of observations to show in the report and slides. 
# DEFAULT is 10. If the number is large the report may be slow.
max_data_report = 10


ProjectData <- read.csv(datafile_name)
ProjectData <- data.matrix(ProjectData) 
ProjectData_INITIAL <- ProjectData
ProjectDatafactor_scaled = apply(ProjectData, 2, function(r) {
    if (sd(r) != 0) 
        res = (r - mean(r))/sd(r) else res = 0 * r
    res
})
ProjectData <- ProjectDatafactor_scaled

source("read_data.R")

# The Business Questions 

The dataset that was used for this analysis contains the following variables: 
1. Satisfaction level - a number between 0 and 1 - level of satisfaction in current function
2. Evaluation - number between 0 and 1 - 
3. Number of projects - number of projects
4. Average monthly hours - From `r min(ProjectData[,4])` to `r max(ProjectData[,4])`
5. Time spent company - number of years worked for the company
6. Work accident - 0 if you've had a work accident, 1 if you have
7. Left - 1 if you've left the company, 0 means you haven't
8. Promotion - 1 if you've had a promotion in the last 5 years, and 0 and if you haven't
9. Department - qualitative (string) 
10. Salary - text - "high", "medium" "low"

Business Questions investigated: 

1. Why are our





# Part 1: Key Customer Characteristics

The code used here is along the lines of the code in the session 3-4 reading  [FactorAnalysisReading.Rmd](https://github.com/InseadDataAnalytics/INSEADAnalytics/blob/master/CourseSessions/Sessions23/FactorAnalysisReading.Rmd). We follow the process described in the [Dimensionality Reduction ](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions23/FactorAnalysisReading.html) reading. 

In this part we also become familiar with:

1. Some visualization tools;
2. Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis;
3. Introduction to machine learning methods;

(All user inputs for this part should be selected in the code chunk in the raw .Rmd file) 

```{r setupfactor, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER then original raw attributes to use. 
# Please use numbers, not column names, e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8
factor_attributes_used = c(1:10)

# Please ENTER the selection criterions for the factors to use. 
# Choices: "eigenvalue", "variance", "manual"
factor_selectionciterion = "manual"

# Please ENTER the desired minumum variance explained 
# (Only used in case "variance" is the factor selection criterion used). 
minimum_variance_explained = 65  # between 1 and 100

# Please ENTER the number of factors to use 
# (Only used in case "manual" is the factor selection criterion used).
manual_numb_factors_used = 10

# Please ENTER the rotation eventually used (e.g. "none", "varimax", "quatimax", "promax", "oblimin", "simplimax", and "cluster" - see help(principal)). Default is "varimax"
rotation_used = "varimax"

```

```{r}
factor_attributes_used <- intersect(factor_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))
ProjectDataFactor <- ProjectData[,factor_attributes_used]
ProjectDataFactor <- ProjectData <- data.matrix(ProjectDataFactor)
```

## Steps 1-2: Check the Data 

Start by some basic visual exploration of, say, a few data:

```{r}
rownames(ProjectDataFactor) <- paste0("Obs.", sprintf("%02i", 1:nrow(ProjectDataFactor)))
iprint.df(t(head(round(ProjectDataFactor, 2), max_data_report)))
```

The data we use here have the following descriptive statistics: 

```{r}
iprint.df(round(my_summary(ProjectDataFactor), 2))
```

## Step 3: Check Correlations

This is the correlation matrix of the customer responses to the `r ncol(ProjectDataFactor)` attitude questions - which are the only questions that we will use for the segmentation (see the case):

```{r}
thecor = round(cor(ProjectDataFactor),2)
iprint.df(round(thecor,2), scale=TRUE)
```

**Questions**

1. Do you see any high correlations between the responses? Do they make sense? 
2. What do these correlations imply?

**Answers:**

*
*
*
*
*
*

## Step 4: Choose number of factors

Clearly the survey asked many redundant questions (can you think some reasons why?), so we may be able to actually "group" these 29 attitude questions into only a few "key factors". This not only will simplify the data, but will also greatly facilitate our understanding of the customers.

To do so, we use methods called [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and [factor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis) as also discussed in the [Dimensionality Reduction readings](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions23/FactorAnalysisReading.html). We can use two different R commands for this (they make slightly different information easily available as output): the command `principal` (check `help(principal)` from R package [psych](http://personality-project.org/r/psych/)), and the command `PCA` from R package [FactoMineR](http://factominer.free.fr) - there are more packages and commands for this, as these methods are very widely used.  

```{r}
# Here is how the `principal` function is used 
UnRotated_Results<-principal(ProjectDataFactor, nfactors=ncol(ProjectDataFactor), rotate="none",score=TRUE)
UnRotated_Factors<-round(UnRotated_Results$loadings,2)
UnRotated_Factors<-as.data.frame(unclass(UnRotated_Factors))
colnames(UnRotated_Factors)<-paste("Comp",1:ncol(UnRotated_Factors),sep="")
```

```{r}
# Here is how we use the `PCA` function 
Variance_Explained_Table_results<-PCA(ProjectDataFactor, graph=FALSE)
Variance_Explained_Table<-Variance_Explained_Table_results$eig
Variance_Explained_Table_copy<-Variance_Explained_Table

rownames(Variance_Explained_Table) <- paste("Component", 1:nrow(Variance_Explained_Table), sep=" ")
colnames(Variance_Explained_Table) <- c("Eigenvalue", "Pct of explained variance", "Cumulative pct of explained variance")
```

Let's look at the **variance explained** as well as the **eigenvalues** (see session readings):

```{r}
iprint.df(round(Variance_Explained_Table, 2))
```

```{r}
eigenvalues  <- Variance_Explained_Table[, "Eigenvalue"]
df           <- cbind(as.data.frame(eigenvalues), c(1:length(eigenvalues)), rep(1, length(eigenvalues)))
colnames(df) <- c("eigenvalues", "components", "abline")
iplot.df(melt(df, id="components"))
```

**Questions:**

1. Can you explain what this table and the plot are? What do they indicate? What can we learn from these?
2. Why does the plot have this specific shape? Could the plotted line be increasing? 
3. What characteristics of these results would we prefer to see? Why?

**Answers**

## Step 5: Interpret the factors

Let's now see how the "top factors" look like. 

```{r}
if (factor_selectionciterion == "eigenvalue")
  factors_selected = sum(Variance_Explained_Table_copy[,1] >= 1)
if (factor_selectionciterion == "variance")
  factors_selected = 1:head(which(Variance_Explained_Table_copy[,"cumulative percentage of variance"]>= minimum_variance_explained),1)
if (factor_selectionciterion == "manual")
  factors_selected = manual_numb_factors_used
```

To better visualize them, we will use what is called a "rotation". There are many rotations methods. In this case we selected the `r rotation_used` rotation. For our data, the `r factors_selected` selected factors look as follows after this rotation: 

```{r}
Rotated_Results<-principal(ProjectDataFactor, nfactors=max(factors_selected), rotate=rotation_used,score=TRUE)
Rotated_Factors<-round(Rotated_Results$loadings,2)
Rotated_Factors<-as.data.frame(unclass(Rotated_Factors))
colnames(Rotated_Factors)<-paste("Comp.",1:ncol(Rotated_Factors),sep="")

sorted_rows <- sort(Rotated_Factors[,1], decreasing = TRUE, index.return = TRUE)$ix
Rotated_Factors <- Rotated_Factors[sorted_rows,]

iprint.df(Rotated_Factors, scale=TRUE)
```

To better visualize and interpret the factors we often "suppress" loadings with small values, e.g. with absolute values smaller than 0.5. In this case our factors look as follows after suppressing the small numbers:

```{r}
Rotated_Factors_thres <- Rotated_Factors
Rotated_Factors_thres[abs(Rotated_Factors_thres) < MIN_VALUE]<-NA
colnames(Rotated_Factors_thres)<- colnames(Rotated_Factors)
rownames(Rotated_Factors_thres)<- rownames(Rotated_Factors)

iprint.df(Rotated_Factors_thres, scale=TRUE)
```

**Questions**

1. What do the first couple of factors mean? Do they make business sense? 
2. How many factors should we choose for this data/customer base? Please try a few and explain your final choice based on a) statistical arguments, b) on interpretation arguments, c) on business arguments (**you need to consider all three types of arguments**)
3. How would you interpret the factors you selected?
4. What lessons about data science do you learn when doing this analysis? Please comment. 

**Answers**

## Step 6:  Save factor scores 

We can now either replace all initial variables used in this part with the factors scores or just select one of the initial variables for each of the selected factors in order to represent that factor. Here is how the factor scores  are for the first few respondents:

```{r}
NEW_ProjectData <- round(Rotated_Results$scores[,1:factors_selected,drop=F],2)
colnames(NEW_ProjectData)<-paste("DV (Factor)",1:ncol(NEW_ProjectData),sep=" ")

iprint.df(t(head(NEW_ProjectData, 10)), scale=TRUE)
```

**Questions**

1. Can you describe some of the people using the new derived variables (factor scores)? 
2. Which of the 29 initial variables would you select to represent each of the factors you selected?

# Part 2: Customer Segmentation 

The code used here is along the lines of the code in the session 5-6 reading  [ClusterAnalysisReading.Rmd](https://github.com/InseadDataAnalytics/INSEADAnalytics/blob/master/CourseSessions/Sessions45/ClusterAnalysisReading.Rmd). We follow the process described in the [Cluster Analysis ](http://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/CourseSessions/Sessions45/ClusterAnalysisReading.html) reading. 

In this part we also become familiar with:

1. Some clustering Methods;
2. How these tools can be used in practice.

A key family of methods used for segmentation is what is called **clustering methods**. This is a very important problem in statistics and **machine learning**, used in all sorts of applications such as in [Amazon's pioneer work on recommender systems](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf). There are many *mathematical methods* for clustering. We will use two very standard methods, **hierarchical clustering** and **k-means**. While the "math" behind all these methods can be complex, the R functions used are relatively simple to use, as we will see. 

(All user inputs for this part should be selected in the code chunk in the raw .Rmd file) 

```{r setupcluster, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
# Please ENTER then original raw attributes to use for the segmentation (the "segmentation attributes")
# Please use numbers, not column names, e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8
segmentation_attributes_used = c(1,2,5) #c(10,19,5,12,3) 

# Please ENTER then original raw attributes to use for the profiling of the segments (the "profiling attributes")
# Please use numbers, not column names, e.g. c(1:5, 7, 8) uses columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8
profile_attributes_used = c(1:5) 

# Please ENTER the number of clusters to eventually use for this report
numb_clusters_used = 3 # for boats possibly use 5, for Mall_Visits use 3

# Please enter the method to use for the segmentation:
profile_with = "hclust" #  "hclust" or "kmeans"

# Please ENTER the distance metric eventually used for the clustering in case of hierarchical clustering 
# (e.g. "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary" or "minkowski" - see help(dist)). 
# DEFAULT is "euclidean"
distance_used = "euclidean"

# Please ENTER the hierarchical clustering method to use (options are:
# "ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid").
# DEFAULT is "ward"
hclust_method = "ward.D"

# Please ENTER the kmeans clustering method to use (options are:
# "Hartigan-Wong", "Lloyd", "Forgy", "MacQueen").
# DEFAULT is "Lloyd"
kmeans_method = "Lloyd"

```

```{r}
# Same as the initial data
ProjectData <- ProjectData_INITIAL

segmentation_attributes_used <- intersect(segmentation_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))
profile_attributes_used <- intersect(profile_attributes_used, 1:ncol(ProjectData))

ProjectData_segment <- ProjectData[,segmentation_attributes_used]
ProjectData_profile <- ProjectData[,profile_attributes_used]

ProjectData_scaled <- apply(ProjectData, 2, function(r) if (sd(r)!=0) (r-mean(r))/sd(r) else 0*r)
```

## Steps 1-2: Explore the data

(This was done above, so we skip it)

## Step 3. Select Segmentation Variables

For simplicity will use one representative question for each of the factor we found in Part 1 (we can also use the "factor scores" for each respondent) to represent our survey respondents. These are the `segmentation_attributes_used` selected below. We can choose the question with the highest absolute factor loading for each factor. For example, when we use 5 factors with the varimax rotation we can select questions Q.1.9 (I see my boat as a status symbol), Q1.18 (Boating gives me a feeling of adventure), Q1.4 (I only consider buying a boat from a reputable brand), Q1.11 (I tend to perform minor boat repairs and maintenance on my own) and Q1.2 (When buying a boat  getting the lowest price is more important than the boat brand) - try it. These are columns 10, 19, 5, 12, and 3, respectively of the data matrix `Projectdata`. 
## Step 4: Define similarity measure

We need to define a distance metric that measures how different people (observations in general) are from each other. This can be an important choice. Here are the differences between the observations using the distance metric we selected:

```{r}
euclidean_pairwise <- as.matrix(dist(head(ProjectData_segment, max_data_report), method="euclidean"))
euclidean_pairwise <- euclidean_pairwise*lower.tri(euclidean_pairwise) + euclidean_pairwise*diag(euclidean_pairwise) + 10e10*upper.tri(euclidean_pairwise)
euclidean_pairwise[euclidean_pairwise==10e10] <- NA
rownames(euclidean_pairwise) <- colnames(euclidean_pairwise) <- sprintf("Obs.%02d", 1:max_data_report)

iprint.df(round(euclidean_pairwise))
```

## Step 5: Visualize Pair-wise Distances

We can see the histogram of, say, the first 2 variables (can you change the code chunk in the raw .Rmd file to see other variables?)

#```{r}
variables_to_plot = 1:2
do.call(iplot.grid, lapply(variables_to_plot, function(n){
  iplot.hist(ProjectData_segment[, n], breaks=2, xlab = paste("Variable", n))
}))
```

or the histogram of all pairwise distances for the `r distance_used` distance:

#```{r}
Pairwise_Distances <- dist(ProjectData_segment, method = distance_used) 
iplot.hist(Pairwise_Distances, breaks=2)
```

## Step 6: Method and Number of Segments

We need to select the clustering method to use, as well as the number of cluster. It may be useful to see the dendrogram from Hierarchical Clustering, to have a quick idea of how the data may be segmented and how many segments there may be. Here is the dendrogram for our data:

```{r}
Hierarchical_Cluster_distances <- dist(ProjectData_segment, method=distance_used)
Hierarchical_Cluster <- hclust(Hierarchical_Cluster_distances, method=hclust_method)
# Display dendogram
iplot.dendrogram(Hierarchical_Cluster)
# TODO: Draw dendogram with red borders around the 3 clusters
# rect.hclust(Hierarchical_Cluster, k=numb_clusters_used, border="red") 
```

We can also plot the "distances" traveled before we need to merge any of the lower and smaller in size clusters into larger ones - the heights of the tree branches that link the clusters as we traverse the tree from its leaves to its root. If we have n observations, this plot has n-1 numbers, we see the first 20 here. 
```{r}
num <- nrow(ProjectData) - 1
df1 <- cbind(as.data.frame(Hierarchical_Cluster$height[length(Hierarchical_Cluster$height):1]), c(1:num))
colnames(df1) <- c("distances","index")
iplot.df(melt(head(df1, 20), id="index"), xlab="Number of Components")
```

Here is the segment membership of the first `r max_data_report` respondents if we use hierarchical clustering:

```{r}
cluster_memberships_hclust <- as.vector(cutree(Hierarchical_Cluster, k=numb_clusters_used)) # cut tree into 3 clusters
cluster_ids_hclust=unique(cluster_memberships_hclust)

ProjectData_with_hclust_membership <- cbind(1:length(cluster_memberships_hclust),cluster_memberships_hclust)
colnames(ProjectData_with_hclust_membership)<-c("Observation Number","Cluster_Membership")

iprint.df(round(head(ProjectData_with_hclust_membership, max_data_report), 2))
```

while this is the segment membership if we use k-means:

```{r}
kmeans_clusters <- kmeans(ProjectData_segment,centers= numb_clusters_used, iter.max=2000, algorithm=kmeans_method)

ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership <- cbind(1:length(kmeans_clusters$cluster),kmeans_clusters$cluster)
colnames(ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership)<-c("Observation Number","Cluster_Membership")

iprint.df(round(head(ProjectData_with_kmeans_membership, max_data_report), 2))
```

## Step 7: Profile and interpret the segments 

In market segmentation one may use variables to **profile** the segments which are not the same (necessarily) as those used to **segment** the market: the latter may be, for example, attitude/needs related (you define segments based on what the customers "need"), while the former may be any information that allows a company to identify the defined customer segments (e.g. demographics, location, etc). Of course deciding which variables to use for segmentation and which to use for profiling (and then **activation** of the segmentation for business purposes) is largely subjective.  In this case we can use all survey questions for profiling for now - the `profile_attributes_used` variables selected below. 

There are many ways to do the profiling of the segments. For example, here we show how the *average* answers of the respondents *in each segment* compare to the *average answer of all respondents* using the ratio of the two.  The idea is that if in a segment the average response to a question is very different (e.g. away from ratio of 1) than the overall average, then that question may indicate something about the segment relative to the total population. 

Here are for example the profiles of the segments using the clusters found above.  First let's see just the average answer people gave to each question for the different segments as well as the total population:

```{r}
cluster_memberships_kmeans <- kmeans_clusters$cluster 
cluster_ids_kmeans <- unique(cluster_memberships_kmeans)

if (profile_with == "hclust"){
  cluster_memberships <- cluster_memberships_hclust
  cluster_ids <-  cluster_ids_hclust  
}
if (profile_with == "kmeans"){
  cluster_memberships <- cluster_memberships_kmeans
  cluster_ids <-  cluster_ids_kmeans
}

# WE WILL USE THESE IN THE CLASSIFICATION PART LATER
NewData = matrix(cluster_memberships,ncol=1)

population_average = matrix(apply(ProjectData_profile, 2, mean), ncol=1)
colnames(population_average) <- "Population"
Cluster_Profile_mean <- sapply(sort(cluster_ids), function(i) apply(ProjectData_profile[(cluster_memberships==i), ], 2, mean))
if (ncol(ProjectData_profile) <2)
  Cluster_Profile_mean=t(Cluster_Profile_mean)
colnames(Cluster_Profile_mean) <- paste("Seg.", 1:length(cluster_ids), sep="")
cluster.profile <- cbind (population_average,Cluster_Profile_mean)

iprint.df(round(cluster.profile, 2))
```

We can also "visualize" the segments using **snake plots** for each cluster. For example, we can plot the means of the profiling variables for each of our clusters to better visualize differences between segments. For better visualization we plot the standardized profiling variables.

```{r}
ProjectData_scaled_profile = ProjectData_scaled[, profile_attributes_used,drop=F]

Cluster_Profile_standar_mean <- sapply(sort(cluster_ids), function(i) apply(ProjectData_scaled_profile[(cluster_memberships==i), ,drop = F], 2, mean))
if (ncol(ProjectData_scaled_profile) < 2)
  Cluster_Profile_standar_mean = t(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean)
colnames(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean) <- paste("Seg ", 1:length(cluster_ids), sep="")

iplot.df(melt(cbind.data.frame(idx=as.numeric(1:nrow(Cluster_Profile_standar_mean)), Cluster_Profile_standar_mean), id="idx"), xlab="Profiling variables (standardized)",  ylab="Mean of cluster")
```

We can also compare the averages of the profiling variables of each segment relative to the average of the variables across the whole population. This can also help us better understand whether  there are indeed clusters in our data (e.g. if all segments are much like the overall population, there may be no segments). For example, we can measure the ratios of the average for each cluster to the average of the population, minus 1, (e.g. `avg(cluster)` `/` `avg(population)` `-1`) for each segment and variable:

```{r}
population_average_matrix <- population_average[,"Population",drop=F] %*% matrix(rep(1,ncol(Cluster_Profile_mean)),nrow=1)
cluster_profile_ratios <- (ifelse(population_average_matrix==0, 0,Cluster_Profile_mean/population_average_matrix))
colnames(cluster_profile_ratios) <- paste("Seg.", 1:ncol(cluster_profile_ratios), sep="")
rownames(cluster_profile_ratios) <- colnames(ProjectData)[profile_attributes_used]
## printing the result in a clean-slate table
iprint.df(round(cluster_profile_ratios-1, 2))
```

**Questions**

1. What do the numbers in the last table indicate? What numbers are the more informative?
2. Based on the tables and snake plot above, what are some key features of each of the segments of this solution?
